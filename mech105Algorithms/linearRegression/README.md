# **Linear Regression **
##	This algorithm takes an input of an x and y array. It first sorts both arrays smallest to largest and ouputs them as fX and fY. Then, after computing the interquartile range of the data, it performs 
linear regressoion on the sorted date creating a line of best fit. The function dosn't output the linar equation directly but instead outputs the slope and intercept of the line. Finally the R^2 value is 
calculated to indicate the accuracy of the linar regression fit.
